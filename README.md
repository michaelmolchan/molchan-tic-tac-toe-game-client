I started this project with the UI so that it would be easier for me to see how the application reacted to the game logic that I built. Once I has a solid foundation for my game I started to work on making the tic-tac-toe game functional. There was a lot of trial and error throughout the entire process as most of the technologies that I used were fairly new to me. That being said, I feel like I have grown as develop as result. Going forward I would love to spend time adding more functionality to the game. I also hope to continue adding to the UI as I had the most fun with the actual design of the project.

Unsolved problems: The only the only thing that I would change would be to spend time go through my code and seeing how I could condense it. I feel like my code seemed excessive at times.
